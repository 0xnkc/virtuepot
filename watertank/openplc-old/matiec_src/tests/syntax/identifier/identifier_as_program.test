(* Test whether the keyword XXXX may be used as an identifier for:
 * Program identifier
 *
 * The XXXX names in the following code are merely a placeholder.
 * They will be replaced by several identifiers before actual testing
 * of the compiler.
 *)

(* The identifiers that will replace the XXXX
 * must be placed on a line starting with #
 * All identifiers preceded by # are ignored!
 * The identifier list must be placed inside an IEC 61131-3 comment.
 *)
(* This file is specific for identifiers identical to IL operators.
 *  See the note following the identifier list

(* NOTE: The identifier as a variable test has some special cases.
 *       Namely, when using IL operators as variable names.
 *       Even though the syntax of the IL language would not result
 *       in ambiguities in the above case, our parser does not currently
 *       allow the use of variables (with names identical to IL
 *       operators) within IL code.
 *
 *       The following test code must therefore consider two possibilities:
 *        - if the identifier under test is an IL operator
 *        - if the identifier under test is not an IL operator
