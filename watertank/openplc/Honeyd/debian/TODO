  available at http://www.trackinghackers.com/solutions/honeyd/

- Consider including the document (check license)
"Honeyd - A Virtual Honeypot Daemon (Extended Abstract)"
 by  Niels Provos, 10th DFN-CERT Workshop, Hamburg, Germany, Feburary 2003.
http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/papers/honeyd-eabstract.pdf

http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/honeyd/contrib.html
  as well as the programs developed in the Honeyd Challenge at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/honeyd/ch01-results/
  which are distributed under a DFSG-free license.
