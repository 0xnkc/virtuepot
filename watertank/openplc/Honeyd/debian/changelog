    exists but it is empty
  * Fix FTBFS when using gcc-4.0 in amd64 with patch from Andreas Jochens
    (Closes: #293037)
  * Default template: (Closes: #305789)
     - Do not use the 'set template uid' command as honeyd does not run
       as root anymore
     - Use full paths for scripts 
  * Fix information in README.Debian:
     - Running scripts with lower privileges requires that the user running
     honeyd has CAP_SETUID
     - Some scripts might log to alternate locations (not
     /var/log/honeypot) and should be reviewed manually
   * Make scripts at /usr/share/honeyd/scripts executable (fixes many lintian
     warnings and makes calling these scripts easier)

honeyd (1.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the possibility of calling farpd from within honeyd's init
    script (farp should provide its own)
  * Added checks in the init.d script to determine the status of the
    honeyd daemon and warn if a start/restart operation does not succeeded
    (for example, if the configuration file or the interface are not
    correct)
  * -x test for $DAEMON moved higher up since there is no need to do 
    a lot of stuff is honeyd is not there.
  * s/arpd/farpd/ in manpage. As that's the name of the program in Debian.

honeyd (1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Introduce a 'honeyd' user and group that is used to launch honeyd
  * Change ownership of /var/log/honeypot/ to the new honeyd user so that
    it can create files there.
  * Updated the documents, including the FAQ (manually, from www.honeyd.org)
  * Changed the Homepage in debian/control from
    http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/honeyd to http://www.honeyd.org
  * Fixed doc-base references to the FAQ (pointed to honeyd's directory
    instead of honeyd-common's)
  * The new webserver is disabled per default since it might allow remote
    users (if permissions are granted to the honeyd user) to change
    honeyd's configuration. However, it is actually quite cool so I 
    would like to encourage others to test it out!
  * The honeyd init script will now stop honeyd even if it's not configured
    yet.

honeyd (0.8-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Honeyd default template now uses 65534 instead of 32767 for uid/gid
  and the README.Debian file describes more what to do in order to 
  run it with lower privileges (changed here instead of the source
  code's default value since it's easier to switch to other users)
  In any case don't expect honeyd to work out of the box without 
  reading how does it need to be configured! (Closes: #237838)
  * The init.d script now logs start and stop daemon attempts
  to $LOGDIR/daemon.log which is also rotated with logrotate.

  the buildds from breaking (all have, save for sparc). This version
  _does_ include AM_MAINTAINER_MODE and the config.{guess,sub} files

honeyd (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #229033) 
  * Added a first attempt of an init.d script and moved configuration
    files to /etc/honeypot, this should make it easier for users to
    startup honeyd with minimum configuration.
  * Added also a log file (new) and logrotation facilities for it.
  * Hacked the configure.in file to be able to run it properly.
  * Added the scripts provided in the "Linux Honeypot Kit" for more
    service emulation (but removed iis-emulator which is in a separate
    package)
  * All common data (documentation and scripts) has now been moved to
    a separate package.
  * Removed python bindings (I cannot get it to work fine, so writting
    scripts in Python for honeyd will have to wait a bit)
  * Disabled yet another nmap OS fingerprint to avoid honeyd's warning:
    Warning: Impossible SI range in Class fingerprint "IBM OS/400 V4R2M0"

  * Converted into a non-native Debian package (mistake in the previous
  build)
  * Removed exec bit from shared library files under /usr/lib/honeyd/
  * Strip the libraries upon installation by modifying the Makefile.in file
  (this probably should be done by automake itself but I don't understand why
  it's not stripping them as well as not installing them mode 0644)
  Unfortunately dh_strip does not catch /usr/lib/libhoneyd, but I'm removing
  it from the package since I consider it useless atm.
