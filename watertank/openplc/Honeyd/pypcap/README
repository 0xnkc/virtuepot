Python pcap module
------------------

this is a simplified object-oriented Python wrapper for libpcap -
the current tcpdump.org version, the legacy version shipping with 
some of the BSD operating systems, and the WinPcap port for Windows.

example use:

>>> import pcap
>>> for ts, pkt in pcap.pcap():
...     print ts, `pkt`
... 

-d.
