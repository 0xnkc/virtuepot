Compilation
-----------

After installation, you can use pkg-config to compile these tests.
For example, to compile random-test-server run:

gcc random-test-server.c -o random-test-server `pkg-config --libs --cflags libmodbus`

random-test-server
-----------------
It's necessary to launch this server before run random-test-client. By
default, it receives and responses to Modbus query on the localhost
and port 1502.

random-test-client
------------------
This programm sends many different queries to a large range of
addresses and values to test the communication between the client and
the server.

unit-test-server
unit-test-client
----------------
By default, this program sends some queries with the values defined in
unit-test.h and checks the responses. These programs are useful to
test the protocol implementation.

bandwidth-server-one
bandwidth-server-many-up
bandwidth-client
-----------------------
It returns some very useful informations about the performance of
transfert rate between the server and the client.

- bandwidth-server-one: it can handles only one connection with a client.
- bandwidth-server-many-up: it opens a connection each time a new client asks
  for, but the number of connection is limited. The same server process handles
  all the connections.
